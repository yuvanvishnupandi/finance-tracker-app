# üí∞ FinTrakk: Personal Finance Tracker Application

FinTrakk is a comprehensive, full-stack personal finance application designed to help users gain granular control over their money. From tracking every transaction to setting actionable budgets and savings goals, FinTrakk provides a clear, visual overview of financial health.

## ‚ú® Features

This project focuses on building a responsive and interactive frontend paired with a robust backend architecture (implied).

### Core Features Completed

* **Secure Authentication:** Full user registration, login, and secure session management.
* **Dynamic Navigation:** Seamless page transitions between all major application routes (Dashboard, Transactions, Accounts, Budgeting, Saving Goals) without full page reloads.
* **Cross-Page Functionality:** Consistent implementation of Dark/Light Mode toggle, Notification Bell, and mobile navigation across all views.
* **Fixed Navigation:** Ensures the theme toggle and navigation links work correctly across conflicting script environments (fixed by making `accounts.js`, `budgeting.js`, and `transactions.js` self-sufficient).

### Financial Management Modules

| Module | Key Functionality | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dashboard** | At-a-glance summary (Net Worth, Income/Expense totals), visual trend charts (Income vs. Expense, Category Breakdown). | Complete (Front-end Structure) |
| **Transactions** | Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for individual transactions, including filtering and sorting. | Complete (Front-end Logic) |
| **Accounts** | **NEW!** Manage multiple financial accounts (Savings, Credit Card, Cash). Calculates **Total Net Worth** and allows users to edit or delete account cards. | Complete (Front-end Logic) |
| **Budgeting** | **NEW!** Set and track monthly spending limits by category. Visual progress bars show spending against limits, with alert indicators for over-budget items. | Complete (Front-end Logic) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

This application is structured as a typical full-stack project with separate frontend and backend directories.

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** and **npm** (or Yarn) installed to run the backend and potentially install frontend dependencies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR REPOSITORY URL]
    cd finance-tracker-app
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend (Mock or API):**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    # Assuming you run the backend on port 8080 or similar
    # node server.js 
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend:**
    The frontend is built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To run it, you need a local web server (like **Live Server** in VS Code or `http-server` via npm).

    ```bash
    # Option A: Using npm's http-server
    # npm install -g http-server
    # cd ..
    # http-server .
    
    # Option B: Running with VS Code Live Server extension
    # Open the project folder in VS Code, right-click 'index.html' inside the 'frontend/auth' folder, and select 'Open with Live Server'.
    ```
    *Ensure the frontend is running on **`http://127.0.0.1:5500`** (or similar) as expected by the JavaScript logic.*
